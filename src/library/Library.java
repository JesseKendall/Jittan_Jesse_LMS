Program Objective:
The library.Library class is responsible for managing the collection of books in the LMS. It will handle functions like loading
books, adding books, removing books, and checking out or checking in books.

I've update the library.Library to the business logic layer - handles the core functionality of the application and have removed
all feedback (i.e. print statements) and user interaction from this layer. The library.Library class doesnâ€™t print anything
because its job is to manage books, not interact with users. Therefore I have placed the UI Layer in the main class.

    //      later add, remove, or retrieve books from it.
